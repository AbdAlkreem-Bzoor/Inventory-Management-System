2. View all products: Display a list of all products in the inventory, along with their prices and quantities.
3. Edit a product: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, allow the user to update its name, price, or quantity.
4. Delete a product: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, remove it. Commit and push.
5. Search for a product: Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, display its name, price, and quantity. If not, let the user know the product was not found.
